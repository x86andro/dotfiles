- `git clone https://github.com/x86andro/dotfiles`
- `cd dotfiles`
- `chmod +x install.sh`
- `./install.sh copy` or `./install.sh symlink`, to either copy the dotfiles or create symlinks at the correct locations

The install script currently installs dependencies only on arch-based distributions, you may need to install the required packages manually.

See the `dotfiles_dependencies()` section of `pacstrap.sh` for the list of required packages.
